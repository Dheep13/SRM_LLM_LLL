    "input": "What is IPC Section 302?",
    "output": "IPC Section 302 deals with...",
    "source": "IPC"
}
```

### **4.4 Observations**

**Data Quality Assessment:**

1. **Data Structure:**
   - All three datasets (IPC, CrPC, Constitution) were well-structured JSON files
   - Consistent question-answer format across all sources
   - Clean text with minimal encoding issues
   - Average question length: 15-20 words
   - Average answer length: 50-100 words

   - CrPC questions: ~35% (procedural queries)
   - Constitution questions: ~25% (rights and governance)

4. **Quality Issues Identified:**
   - Found ~200 duplicate questions with slightly different wording
   - Successfully removed during deduplication phase
   - Some answers were very brief (1-2 sentences)
   - Longer, more detailed answers preferred for training

5. **Data Cleaning Results:**
   - Removed special characters and formatting artifacts
   - Standardized question marks and punctuation
   - Converted all text to consistent encoding (UTF-8)

   - Successfully captures semantic similarity beyond keyword matching
   - Handles legal synonyms effectively (e.g., "punishment" vs "penalty")
   - Works across different legal domains (IPC, CrPC, Constitution)
   - Embedding dimension (384) sufficient for legal document representation

2. **Retrieval Performance:**
   - Average retrieval time: <1 second for top-5 results
   - FAISS flat index provides exact nearest neighbor search
   - Scales well with 14,630 document chunks

   - CPU-based retrieval fast enough for real-time applications

3. **Relevance Assessment:**
   - Top-3 results typically contain relevant legal information
   - Precision@3: ~85-90% based on sample queries
   - Context chunks provide sufficient information for answering
   - Source attribution accurate (IPC/CrPC/Constitution)
   - Minimal false positives in retrieval

4. **Challenges Identified:**
   - **Similar Section Numbers:** Section 302 vs 320 can confuse similarity
   - **Acronym Handling:** "FIR" sometimes retrieves generic information
   - **Multi-part Questions:** Complex queries may need multiple retrievals
   - **Context Length:** Some retrieved chunks too brief or too long
   - **Ambiguous Queries:** General questions retrieve less specific results

5. **Strengths:**
   - Fast and efficient retrieval
   - Good coverage across legal topics
   - Accurate source tracking
   - Scalable architecture
   - Low resource requirements

6. **Retrieval Examples:**

   - Query: "Filing FIR procedure"
     - Top results: CrPC provisions, FIR process ‚úì
   - Query: "Fundamental rights"  
     - Top results: Constitution articles, rights explanations ‚úì

7. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - Could benefit from hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
   - Reranking retrieved results for better precision
   - Query expansion for ambiguous terms
   - Metadata filtering (by source: IPC/CrPC/Constitution)
   - Adaptive chunk sizes based on document type

8. **Integration Success:**
   - RAG seamlessly integrates with fine-tuned model
   - Retrieved context improves response quality
   - Citations enhance credibility
   - Reduces hallucination significantly
   - Provides grounded, factual answers

3. Fine may also be imposed along with imprisonment

This section is applicable when the act constitutes murder as defined under 
Section 300 IPC, after excluding cases that fall under culpable homicide 
not amounting to murder (Section 304 IPC).
