- ✅ Legal term detection
- ✅ Rule-based responses
- ❌ No fine-tuned model loading

**Performance:**
- Startup: ~10 seconds
- RAM: ~500MB
- Response time: <1 second

**Best for:**
- Quick demos
- Low-resource systems
- Reliable screenshots
- Fast testing

**Example Output:**
```
📚 Retrieved Context:
[1] IPC Section 302 deals with punishment for murder...

💡 Response:
Based on Indian legal documents:
IPC Section 302 deals with punishment for murder. The punishment can be:
• Death penalty, or
• Life imprisonment
```

## Option 2: Full Model + RAG (High Quality) 🚀

**Script:** `full_inference.py` ⭐ **NEW!**

**What it uses:**
- ✅ RAG retrieval (14,630 chunks)
- ✅ Legal term detection
- ✅ **Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model**
- ✅ LLM-generated responses

**Performance:**
- Startup: 2-5 minutes (CPU) / 30 seconds (GPU)
- RAM: 4-8GB
- Response time: 10-30 seconds per query (CPU)

**Best for:**
- High-quality responses
- Demonstrating fine-tuned model
- Production use (with GPU)
- Final submission demos

**Example Output:**
```

🤖 LawBot Response (Fine-Tuned Model + RAG):
─────────────────────────────────────────────
IPC Section 302 is one of the most serious provisions in the Indian 
Penal Code. It deals with the punishment for murder, which is defined 
as causing death with the intention to cause death or with the knowledge 
that the act is likely to cause death.

The punishment under Section 302 can be:
1. Death penalty (capital punishment)
2. Life imprisonment (imprisonment for the natural life of the convict)
3. Fine may also be imposed along with imprisonment

This section is applicable when the act constitutes murder as defined 
under Section 300 IPC, after excluding cases that fall under culpable 
homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304 IPC).

- Runs automated tests
- Shows RAG retrieval
- No interactive input
- Quick verification

**Script:** `check_status.py`

**What it does:**
- Verifies all components
- No model loading
- Instant results

## 🎯 Recommendation for Submission

### For Screenshots & PDF Report:

**1. Use `simple_chat.py` for:**
- Quick demonstrations
- Multiple Q&A examples
- Showing RAG retrieval works
- Reliable, fast results

**2. Use `full_inference.py` for:**
- 1-2 high-quality examples
- Demonstrating fine-tuned model
- Showing LLM generation quality
- "Wow factor" screenshots

**3. Mention both in report:**
```
"The system offers two inference modes:

1. RAG-Only Mode (simple_chat.py): Fast, lightweight demonstration
   of retrieval capabilities with rule-based generation.

2. Full Model Mode (full_inference.py): Complete system using 
   fine-tuned Qwen2.5-1.5B with LoRA adapters combined with RAG
   retrieval for high-quality legal responses."
```

## 🚀 How to Use Each

### RAG-Only (Quick Demo):
```powershell
python simple_chat.py
```
- Starts in 10 seconds
- Ask multiple questions
- Great for screenshots

### Full Model (Best Quality):
```powershell
python full_inference.py
```
- Wait 2-5 minutes for loading
- Ask 1-2 important questions
- Best quality responses
- Show this for "final demo"

### Quick Check:
```powershell
python check_status.py
```
- Verify everything is ready
- No waiting

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with `check_status.py`** to verify everything
2. **Use `simple_chat.py`** for most of your testing
3. **Use `full_inference.py`** for 1-2 impressive examples
4. **Be patient** - model loading takes time but works!
5. **Don't interrupt** during loading (causes issues)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Loading Times:**
- First time: Downloads embedding model (~500MB cache)
- Subsequent runs: Faster (uses cache)
- CPU loading: 2-5 minutes
- GPU loading: 30-60 seconds

**Memory Requirements:**
- `simple_chat.py`: 500MB (works on any PC)
- `full_inference.py`: 4-8GB (needs decent RAM)

**When to Use What:**
- Testing/exploration: Use `simple_chat.py`
- Final demo/submission: Use `full_inference.py` for 1-2 examples
- Verification: Use `check_status.py`

---

## 🎉 Both Options Work Great!

Choose based on your needs:
- **Speed** → `simple_chat.py`
- **Quality** → `full_inference.py`
- **Both** → Use both in your report! ✅
