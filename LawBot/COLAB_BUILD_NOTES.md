# Colab Build Time Guide

## xformers Building Wheels - Normal and Necessary

**What you're seeing:**
```
Building wheels for collected packages: xformers
Building wheel for xformers (setup.py) ... 
```

**Time:** 5-15 minutes  
**Status:** This is NORMAL and EXPECTED! ✅

## Why It Takes Time

xformers is NOT available as a pre-built wheel for your Python version, so Colab must:
1. Download source code
2. Compile C++ extensions
3. Build the wheel from source

This happens because:
- Unsloth requires a specific xformers version: `xformers<0.0.26`
- That version may not have pre-built wheels for Python 3.12
- So it has to compile from source

## What to Expect

**Progress indicators:**
```
Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... done          ← 1-2 min
Building wheel for xformers (setup.py) ...      ← 5-15 min
Done building wheel for xformers               ← Success!
```

**Then you'll see:**
```
Successfully installed xformers-0.0.25.post2
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Don't interrupt it!** Let it finish
2. **It will succeed** - just be patient
3. **This is a one-time build** - subsequent runs are faster
4. **You can minimize the cell** - it will keep running

## After Build Completes

You'll see something like:
```
Successfully installed xformers-0.0.25.post2
✅ Installed all dependencies!
```

Then the next cells will run fast.

## If It Seems Stuck

**Signs it's working:**
- CPU usage spikes (expected during compilation)
- Output continues to appear
- No error messages

**Signs it's stuck:**
- No output for 30+ minutes
- Error messages appear

**If stuck:**
- Restart runtime
- Re-run the cell
- Sometimes Colab instances have compilation issues

## Alternative: Skip xformers

If xformers keeps failing, you can comment out that line:

```python
# !pip install --no-deps "xformers<0.0.26" trl peft accelerate bitsandbytes
```

And just use:
```python
!pip install trl peft accelerate bitsandbytes
```

But xformers improves performance, so it's worth the wait!

## Estimated Total Time

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Install dependencies | 5-15 min |
| Load model | 2-3 min |
| Phase 2 training | 1-2 hours |
| **Total** | **~2 hours** |

**Bottom line:** The wheel building is normal. Just wait 5-15 minutes! ☕
