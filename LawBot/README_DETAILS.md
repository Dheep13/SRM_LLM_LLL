# LawBot Project - Important Details

## Security Notice

**DO NOT commit any files with real credentials to Git!**

The following files should NEVER be tracked:
- `google_drive_connection.json` (removed & added to .gitignore)
- `.env` files with real API keys
- Any files with `client_secret` or tokens

## Current Project Status

âœ… **All 6 phase notebooks created**  
âœ… **No configuration needed to run**  
âœ… **Works entirely in Google Colab**  
âœ… **No API keys required**  

## About Those Google OAuth2 Credentials

You have a `google_drive_connection.json` file with OAuth2 credentials. This is:

**What it is:** Google Cloud Platform OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive API

**What you need it for:** Nothing in this project! 

**Why it exists:** You probably created these for another project

**What to do with it:**
1. Keep it local (never commit)
2. Delete it if you're sure it's not needed
3. Ignore it for this assignment

## For This Assignment

You don't need:
- âœ… Google Drive API
- âœ… OAuth2 credentials  
- âœ… Client ID/Secret
- âœ… Any of those JSON files

You just need:
- âœ… Google Colab (free)
- âœ… The 6 notebooks
- âœ… The 3 dataset JSON files
- âœ… That's it!

## If You Want to Use Drive (Optional)

If you later want to save outputs to Google Drive, the simple way is:

```python
# In a Colab notebook, just add:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Now use /content/drive/MyDrive/ for your paths
```

**This works without ANY credentials!** It uses your Google account login.

## Next Steps

1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload the Phase 1 notebook  
3. Start the project!

Everything else is already set up. ðŸŽ‰
